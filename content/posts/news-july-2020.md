Join us for a night of Post Punk, Goth and Darkwave bands and DJs bringing the dark club vibes party like its 1980, 1990 or 2020.

Stars and the Underground after a successful tour in Australia in 2019 and performances with Drab Majesty(US) 
and at Shadowplay in Wellington hit the road again to Celebrate the release of their new single "Nosferatu Upon Tyne".   

They play a unique mix of Post Punk, Shoegaze and Dark Electronic music.    

Great mates Nocturne play raw Gothic Punk originals and covers are sure to please with their intense live performance. 

Mr M also joins the Dark Shadows line up for very special guest appearance to play his beautiful brand of folk Noir.

DJs Bad Juju and R. G. Bargy will keep the vibes going before after and in between the bands.    

Tix Presale from UTR $8 plus BF or $10 on the door.
