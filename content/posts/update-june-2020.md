Slowly life is returning to normal in New Zealand, well as normal as it can be. After months
in isolation our first meetup as a group occurs tomorrow we will of course exercising social distancing.

We meet at John Mcdermott studio's to mix the first song off our new album. We are excited...

We have a collection of material accumulating both recorded and in demo form which we will work through
to complete and decide whether we will use it for the album.

The initial sound displayed on our previous release ep "The Evolution Circle" is now being elaborated on and
a fuller band sound is coming to the fore with the addition of our new members Cat on (Keyboards) and Ari on bass
joining Sean and I.

"Nosferatu Upon Tyne" will mark Kat and Ari's first recorded contributions to the project.

The single will be released on BandCamp and Spotify with a limited 7 inch lathe cut vinyl featuring a remix by Eleanor Rayner (Robots In Love).

Mark Wallbank (Hieronymous Bosch, Haunted Auckland) is providing us with a video for "Nosferatu Upon Tyne" which be released shortly.

We look forward to more shows once it is safe to do so to support this release.
