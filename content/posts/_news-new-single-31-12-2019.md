We are due back in the studio in March 2020 to record a new single "Nosferatu Upon Tyne".

We are recording at Arch Hill Recording Studios in Auckland with John McDermott.

This recording session was the first for our new bass player Ari and our keyboard player Cat.

We enjoyed track laying with John and the drums he laid down were awesome.

Another session will be required to tie some loose ends on the track and to mix.
