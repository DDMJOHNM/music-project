We recorded a new single "Nosferatu Upon Tyne" at Arch Hill Recording Studios in Auckland with John McDermott.

The recording session was the first for our new bass player Ari and our keyboard player Cat.

We enjoyed track laying with John and the drums he laid down were awesome.

Another session will be required to tie some loose ends on the track and to mix. 

Then the virus hit....
