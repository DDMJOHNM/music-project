My name is John Mason and I am a singer songwriter based in Auckland, New Zealand my music inhabits the Post Punk, Shoe Gaze, and Dark Electronic genres.

I cut my musical teeth in a band called "Winterland" formed with Mike Caulfield in the early 2000s we released two EPs and an album and a video. 

We played Sweetwaters, the 95bFM Summer Series, Club Bizarre's Vampyre and Nocturne Balls, and Mediatrix's The Darkness Gathering received nationwide radio airplay for several tracks.

We released our music in the UK, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. and once the legendary Chris Knox played our album release show.
 
The first period of Stars occurred around 2004 after Winterland took an indefinite hiatus mainly as a recording project.

After a long time away from music between 2014 and 2016 I formed a few projects with Carlos Antonio "Humaniser" and "Ashes the Condition" these projects inspired me to keep writing and aspire to play more once I found a direction again.

While some parallels do exist between Winterland and Stars, Winterland was more Goth Rock whereas Stars is a hybrid of styles and influences that stretch across Post Punk, Shoe Gaze and Dark Electronic and less vocally driven than Winterland.

Even though Stars is a solo project I've always wanted it to be collaborative, and I call upon my good musical friends when they are available Sean OKane Connolly (Undiscovered Moons Of Saturn) and Mark Wallbank (Hieronymus Bosch/Polter:Geist) their input is emmence.
