## About

My name is John Mason and I am a singer songwriter based in Auckland, New Zealand my music inhabits the Post Punk, Shoe Gaze, and Dark Electronic genres. 
 
I cut my musical teeth in a band called "Winterland" formed with Mike Caulﬁeld in the early 2000s we released two EPs and an album and a video.  
 
We played Sweetwaters, the 95bFM Summer Series, Club Bizarre's Vampyre and Nocturne Balls, and Mediatrix's The Darkness Gathering received naonwide radio airplay for several tracks. 
 
We released our music in the UK, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. Once the legendary Chris Knox played our album release show. 
 
While some parallels do exist between Winterland and Stars, Winterland was more Goth Rock whereas Stars is a hybrid of styles and inﬂuences that stretch across Post Punk, Shoe Gaze and Dark Electronic and less vocally driven than Winterland. 
 
Even though Stars is a solo project I've always wanted it to be collaborave, and I call upon my good musical friends when they are available Sean OKane Connolly (Undiscovered Moons Of Saturn), Cat Veen (Antoinette's Head) and Mark Wallbank (Hieronymus Bosch/Polter:Geist) their input is emmence.  
 
Stars and the Underground is currently building up to the release of our debut album "Without The Dark There Is No Light" in 2020. We have recently released a 4 track digital sampler called "The Evolution Circle" EP Digitally on Band Camp and Spotify. 
 
We also recently played a series of dates in Australia and New Zealand including an international support with Dais Record's Drab Majesty. 
 
We are recording a single in early 2020 and will release it and tour mid 2020.
