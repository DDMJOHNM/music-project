<p>Stars and the Underground was orginally the solo project of John Mason a singer/songwriter based in Auckland, New Zealand (formally of NZ Goth Rockers Winterland).</p>
<p>The evolution of &ldquo;Stars&rdquo; as fans refer to the band as started when Sean O&rsquo;Kane Connolly a close friend and John realised a dream to finally play together. Sean is a talanted multi instrumentalist who has a number of projects in his own right (Undiscovered Moons Of Saturn, and more laterly Shistocyte). Sean walked into the studio and instantly added a unique vibe to the Evolution Circle EP which we recorded with Darryn Harkness at the Tone Exchange.</p>
<p>We embarked upon an Australasian tour in 2019 on the back of the Evolution Circle EP and really enjoyed the fact we could appeal to fans of Post Punk, Goth, Shoegaze and Dark Electronic music alike. The goal was always to create a unique sound which sometimes people find differcult to pin immediately but we think looking forward to the album this will make more sense to people over a longer format.</p>
<p>We also have supported Dias Records act Drab Majesty when they came through to New Zealand in 2019.</p>
<p>After a break mainly due to the coronavirus outbreak we embarked on a mission to beef up the bands sound and our old pal and creative friend Mark Wallbank (who also directs our videos) registered Cat Veen&rsquo;s interest in joining the band. Cat was one of the principle songwriting forces behind Antoinette&rsquo;s Head a goth rock band also from Auckland we used to play together in those early New Zealand Gothic balls in the late 90s and early 2000s. Kat will add another style of playing and voice and she has a classical music background.</p>
<p>After playing her first show with us at Shadowplay in Wellington Kat took matters into her only hands when Sean was sneaking a quick pre set sleep she has been endeared to the band even more ever since!</p>

<p>After Kat joined we felt a bass player would be a great addition to the band we advertised and Ari applied after (actually listening to.. ) and liking our music and was accepted him into the group straight away. Ari played for a band called Datura (quite heavy) and has alot of recording and programming and songwriting expertise in the electronic arena also. Ari brings a different sphere of influences but totally understands what we are trying to do so we are looking forward to tapping into his great many talents.</p>
<p>The post Covid 19 world in New Zealand is starting to take shape so we look forward to the next stage in the evolution of the band.</p>
<p>For Stars this will be the release of the first single off our forthcoming album called &ldquo;Nosferatu Upon Tyne&rdquo; we began recording the track
at Arch Hill Recording Studios with John McDermott a close friend and brilliant drummer and producer in his own right. This track features
the new line up for the first time in the studio together.</p>
<p>This song is from the more Post Punk/Goth Rock side of the project, further release details, and shows as they come to hand will be announced. &ldquo;Nosferatu&rdquo; is symbolic attempt to personify fear and anxiety as very powerful human emotions and the lyrical chant at the end of the track we wish to serve as a remninder that by facing your fear in life anyone, who has dug a deep whole mentally for themselves, there is always hope that one can prise themselves enough sunlight albeit through a very small hole sometimes can make themseleves enough room to climb out&hellip;</p>
