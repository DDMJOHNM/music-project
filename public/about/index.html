            <h1>About</h1>
        </header>
        
        <p>My name is John Mason and I am a singer songwriter based in Auckland, New Zealand my music inhabits the Post Punk, Shoe Gaze, and Dark Electronic genres.</p>
<p>I cut my musical teeth in a band called &ldquo;Winterland&rdquo; formed with Mike Caulﬁeld in the early 2000s we released two EPs and an album and a video.</p>
<p>We played Sweetwaters, the 95bFM Summer Series, Club Bizarre's Vampyre and Nocturne Balls, and Mediatrix's The Darkness Gathering received naonwide radio airplay for several tracks.</p>
<p>We released our music in the UK, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. Once the legendary Chris Knox played our album release show.</p>
<p>While some parallels do exist between Winterland and Stars, Winterland was more Goth Rock whereas Stars is a hybrid of styles and inﬂuences that stretch across Post Punk, Shoe Gaze and Dark Electronic and less vocally driven than Winterland.</p>
<p>Even though Stars is a solo project I've always wanted it to be collaborave, and I call upon my good musical friends when they are available Sean OKane Connolly (Undiscovered Moons Of Saturn), Cat Veen (Antoinette's Head) and Mark Wallbank (Hieronymus Bosch/Polter:Geist) their input is emmence.</p>
<p>Stars and the Underground is currently building up to the release of our debut album &ldquo;Without The Dark There Is No Light&rdquo; in 2020. We have recently released a 4 track digital sampler called &ldquo;The Evolution Circle&rdquo; EP Digitally on Band Camp and Spotify.</p>
<p>We also recently played a series of dates in Australia and New Zealand including an international support with Dais Record's Drab Majesty.</p>
<p>We are recording a single in early 2020 and will release it and tour mid 2020.</p>
