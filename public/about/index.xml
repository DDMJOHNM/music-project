      <description>My name is John Mason and I am a singer songwriter based in Auckland, New Zealand my music inhabits the Post Punk, Shoe Gaze, and Dark Electronic genres.
I cut my musical teeth in a band called &amp;ldquo;Winterland&amp;rdquo; formed with Mike Caulfield in the early 2000s we released two EPs and an album and a video.
We played Sweetwaters, the 95bFM Summer Series, Club Bizarre&#39;s Vampyre and Nocturne Balls, and Mediatrix&#39;s The Darkness Gathering received nationwide radio airplay for several tracks.</description>
