<p>We meet at John Mcdermott studio&rsquo;s to mix the first song off our new album. We are excited&hellip;</p>
<p>We have a collection of material accumulating both recorded and in demo form which we will work through
to complete and decide whether we will use it for the album.</p>
<p>The initial sound displayed on our previous release ep &ldquo;The Evolution Circle&rdquo; is now being elaborated on and
a fuller band sound is coming to the fore with the addition of our new members Cat on (Keyboards) and Ari on bass
joining Sean and I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nosferatu Upon Tyne&rdquo; will mark Kat and Ari&rsquo;s first recorded contributions to the project.</p>
<p>The single will be released on BandCamp and Spotify with a limited 7 inch lathe cut vinyl featuring a remix by Eleanor Rayner (Robots In Love).</p>
<p>Mark Wallbank (Hieronymous Bosch, Haunted Auckland) is providing us with a video for &ldquo;Nosferatu Upon Tyne&rdquo; which be released shortly.</p>
<p>We look forward to more shows once it is safe to do so to support this release.</p>
